* Requires GNU Scientific Library for RNG.

brumbrella.cc		: 1D BD simulation code, on bistable potential,
			: with optional umbrella potential

diff_model.cc		: utilities for fitting 1D diffusive models
diff_model.h		: utilities for fitting 1D diffusive models

diffit.cc		: master code for 1D diffusive fits

thist.cc		: code for constructing transition matrices "oven-ready"
			: for input to diffit

example_fit.csh		: a helpful example of fitting data from long
			 simulations at equilibrium, no bias/umbrella
			- generates brownian dynamics data
			- bins it into transition matrix
			- fits diffusion model

test_umbrella.csh	: a less helpful example but which nonetheless
			illustrates more of the code's functionality
